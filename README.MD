Charix is not just a blockchain project—it is a catalyst for positive change, enabling creators to thrive in a world where talent deserves recognition and support.

## Problem Statement  
The problem Charix is solving is the lack of access to funding and recognition for artists, particularly those in unrecognized or underprivileged communities in LPU. 

## Identifying the Challenges for LPU Artists  
LPU artists face a number of challenges, particularly when trying to raise funds, gain recognition, and access opportunities. The traditional platforms often have high intermediary costs and lack transparency, leaving creators struggling to realize their full potential.  

## Problems in Traditional Platforms  
1. **High Intermediary Costs**  
   Students or artists at LPU often have to pay large costs to third parties to get funds. These expenses can suppress the growth of artists.  
   
2. **Lack of Transparency**  
   Traditional platforms often operate without clear and transparent mechanisms for distributing funds or revenue. This lack of transparency can erode trust within the community.

## Unique Selling Proposition (USP) for LPU Artists
